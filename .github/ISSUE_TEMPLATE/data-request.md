Hi

My name is **name* and I work at **research center** with **people** and I focus my research on **topics**

I need some extractions I cannot seem to find in the catalog of existing extractions (I carefully checked the [catalog](https://meom-group.github.io/meom-data-catalog/) ) in order to study **this particular thing**

What I need is an extraction of :
 - **simulation**
 - for variable(s) **variable(s)**
 - for the region **region**
 - for the period **period**
 - for detph **depth**
 - at a **frequency** frequency
 - I can easily retrieve this new extraction on **platform** (if you are out of MEOM, Grenoble campus and french supercomputers, default is opendap)

Thank you !
